As we can see, the vehicle class is being inherited by jeep,sports,passenger vehicle in sports
and Jeep wanted a common capability which is not present in the parent class
as it is not present we have written the same functionality in both the classes again separately
 so this is duplication of code and if some other classes require
same functionality again we have to implement the same method
which is not scalable so this is the reason we need strategy design pattern
